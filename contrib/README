Enclosed are examples of how to use the NicTool API. Some use NicToolTest, which is a very, very basic framework for using NicTool. Instead, use NicTool, from NicToolServer/sys/client/  instead.

DNS.pm is a good example of how to encapsulate NicTool API methods for automated use.

For a modern high(er) quality example, look at the NicTool module on Provision::Unix. You can find Provision::Unix on CPAN.
