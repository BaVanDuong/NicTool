 2.10 - 2011.
    * ripped out service_type
    * removed more legacy RCS $Id: headers (comments)
    * SQL; renamed nt_zone.output_format to export_format
    * SQL: converted deleted database fields from enum to tinyint(1)
      (enums are evil. Their contents are strings. Having to quote numeric 
       values in every query has ALWAYS irritated me about NicTool. ENUM is 
       MySQL proprietary, and they often don't behave as expected). 
    * SQL: added nt_nameesrver.export_serials (controls export of serial nums
      for tinydns export).
    * removed the quotes from many integers. Someone wasn't thinking...

 2.09 - 2011.10
    * removed all summary code (unused)
    * packaged client and server together (simplify distribution)
