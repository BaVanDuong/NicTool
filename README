NicTool is a free DNS management suite that takes the headaches out of managing DNS data. NicTool works great for managing one zone or millions of zones. NicTool works well with one nameserver or dozens of nameservers.

NicTool is a DNS manager, not a DNS server. NicTool can import DNS data from BIND or tinydns files. NicTool exports sanitized and validated DNS data to authoritative DNS servers including tinydns, BIND, PowerDNS, NSD, Knot, and MaraDNS. NicTool also exports to DynECT Managed DNS.

NicTool is Open Source. Contributions are welcome. Fork NicTool on GitHub: https://github.com/msimerson/NicTool

NicTool includes:

    a web interface for users, admins, and clients
    validation of DNS data before acceptance
    fine grained permissions for users and groups
    delegatation of zones and zone records to users and/or groups.
    logging of all DNS changes (who did what & when)
    RDBMS data storage
    a mature API for automation and integration

NicTool Server is the server component of NicTool. It exposes the DNS data via a SOAP web service. The format of requests is defined in the reference API at http://www.nictool.com/docs/api/. The NicTool API and NicTool Client connect to NicTool Server. Changes to DNS data (zones, records, nameservers) and managers (users and groups) are validated before insertion.

NicTool Client is a CGI application. It is what you see in the browser. It provides a web interface for managing DNS data. NicTool Client has customizable HTML templates and a CSS style sheet. It is slowly becoming a modern JS web app.

The NicTool API is a mature API for connecting to NicTool Server and managing DNS data. There are many scripts written against this API.

Usage Examples: 

    ColocateUSA.net (2012-): Custom scripts for web services (billing, orders, CP) to set & reset rDNS, and CLI scripts to update forward and rDNS for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

    Spry/VPSlink (2007-2010): Integration with a custom control so VM clients could manage their domains and rDNS.

    Layered Tech (2005-2007): DNS management was limited to internal staff and was updated as needed. Which meant, lots of old poorly maintained data. I wrote a number of scripts for common tasks like "reset the rDNS for these IPs" or "delegate this block of IPs to these NS".

    Lightrealm/HostPro/Interland/Web.com (2000-2003): In 1999, Lightrealm's DNS was managed on Sun servers running BIND 4. DNS team members used a shared login for access and editing of the zone and named.conf files. We had 120,000 zones and reloading BIND took about 12 hours, so it was done once a day. If someone made an error, it might take 10 hours before BIND encountered it and croaked, sometimes extending the time-to-publish of DNS data to days.
    With the pending merger of Lightrealm, Vservers, and HostPro, our zone count was going to almost triple. We needed a better solution and found NicTool. We deployed a system that elegantly managed 400,000 zones, millions of zone records, and published changes in under a minute. NicTool remained in use at Web.com for many years thereafter.
