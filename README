NicTool is a free DNS management suite.

Once installed and set up, NicTool takes the headaches out of managing DNS. NicTool includes:
  an attractive web interface for users, admins, and clients
  a rich API for provisioning systems
  validation of all DNS entries before acceptance
  logging of all DNS changes (who did what & when)
  granular permissions, for delegating the management of users, groups, zones, and even zone records to third parties.

DNS data is stored in a database and is exported by scripts to the DNS server of choice (tinydns, BIND, PowerDNS).

NicTool is the holy grail of DNS management packages. It works great for managing one zone, or a million of them.
