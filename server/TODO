----NEW----

. RFC 4035: modify CNAME to allow it to coexist with NSEC & RRSIG

. Exports: make sure another export for the same NSID is not running. This can
    happen on a NS with extremely large (many hundreds of thousands) record
    sets and very short export intervals. Consider an export concurrency limit.

. RFC 3490, IDNA (International Domain Names in Applications)
..  RFC 5890 - 5894 (IDNA 2008)

. RFC 2181, RRSet restrictions
.. Make sure TTL on RRs with identical label and type are identical
.. If RR has identical label, type, and data as existing RR, reject as invalid

. Support tinydns locations
    SQL & tinydns export portions completed 2011.11.14. See
    https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,1004.0.html

. Support BIND views

. If a user does not have delete permission for a zone/zone record, they
    should not have restore permissions
    https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,797.0.html

. Fix bug: login returns nt_perm_id and perm_name in user hash, and should not.

. Support other database engines:
..  remove all MySQL specific ENUM columns
..  test against sqlite

. Support for NAPTR records: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3403

. SPF records: when creating or editing a SPF record, check for an TXT record.
    If TXT doesn't exist, create it. If exists, update it with SPF record.
    RFC 4408 ("recommends to always provide a TXT based SPF RR...and duplicate
    the information")

. Fix hostmaster.ZONE.TLD entries in nt_zone table.
..  Have Zone::new_zone automatically rewrite those entries before insertion.
..  Update the JS to format that value more intelligently

==== COMPLETED =====

. Fix hostmaster.ZONE.TLD entries in nt_zone table.
..  UPDATE nt_zone SET mailaddr=CONCAT('hostmaster.',zone,'.') WHERE mailaddr LIKE 'hostmaster.ZONE.TLD%';

. add SSHFP record type: http://www.openssh.org/txt/rfc4255.txt

. Limit the num of export logs retained. Prune successful "0 zones changed" log entries older than 1 day.

. nt_zone_record.type is a numeric code from the resource_record_type table (was an enum)

. Support for SPF record type

. Collate a useful export report and DROP nictool.nt_nameserver_export_procstatus.

. SQL migration query to populate nt_zone_nameservers from nt_zone.ns0..ns9

. Crypt the user passwords (requires schema changes)

. Make sure password length is not longer than SQL table allows. otherwise,
   matching password will get truncated in the table and won't match upon
   auth attempts. DONE - mps 10/13/2007

. Update documentation for API to note limit of 100 record max.
   (https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,800.0.html)
   - DONE - mps 10/13/2007

. Fix Sanity checks which have changed with API/Permissions changes
    group,user,zone,record,nameserver - DONE -gws 3/4/02

. Fix bug: get_group_zones (And other functions which conform to the
search interface) should error if the "x_option" parameter (or others)
have an incorrect value: can be done in Sanity
    DONE - gws 3/4/02

. Matt's bugs: Sanity check on new resource records for conformance to
RFC 1035, as much as possible.  Determine policy re: DNS lookups
...maybe allow it to work, but issue warning about possibility of
non-conformance to RFC.
    DONE - gws 3/1/02

        4a. Modify NicToolClient to deal with Warnings explicitly that are not
failures.

. Upgrade script for v 1.06x to v 2.00
        - add nt_perm tables
        - add entries in nt_perm for all groups
        - prompt install person for permissions for non-root groups?

. Complete test scripts to test new features, verify old things work
correctly:
        6a. make sure Client Framework code is good/is working
        6b. write the damn scripts, (should be easier w/ client framework)
        6c. write sample scripts + documentation to make it usable.
        6c. Maybe package Client Framework separately from NicToolServer, like
with NicToolClient or something..

. API DOCUMENTATION NEEDS TO BE UPDATED: gah, lots of changes, fixes to
old bugs need to be done......YOU CAN HELP: maybe...
This item has the highest usefulness vs. enjoyability rating in terms of
finishing NicTool

.undelete for zones/finding deleted zones
    DID  3/4/02 -  changed edit_zone to allow 'deleted' parameter to undelete deleted zones (no way to delete that way) (cannot undelete zone if the same 'zone' is used by a non-deleted zone)
                -   changed delete_zones to not delete records
                -   changed get_group_zones to allow 'search_deleted' parameter to
                        perform search only on deleted zones



----OLD----
- sanity when moving objects
- security when moving objects
- tweaks for gracefully handling reverse DNS
- nt_zone_nameserver_log
- import tools
	- BINDParse, DJBParse perl modules
	- web interface tools
	- command line tools
- double check that everything from network is dbh->quoted
- transaction queueing layer, examine possible failure points, solutions
- make dist should clean out developer-specific DB usernames/passes, etc (*.sql)
- DES encrypt client-local messages (to thwart cross-site scripting hacks)
- standardization of error/response codes
- multiple xml-rpc/SOAP per-connection -- keep-alive: possible?
- SSL layer testing
- user documentation
- soft errors/warnings
- nameserver permission check (need to define exact policy first)
- client/server versions could differ, but should be displayed by client
