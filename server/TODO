----NEW----

. Support tinydns locations and/or BIND views
    SQL & tinydns export portions completed 2011.11.14. See
    https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,1004.0.html

. Support BIND views

. If a user does not have delete permission for a zone/zone record, they should also not have restore permissions (https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,797.0.html)

. Fix bug: login returns nt_perm_id and perm_name in user hash, and should not.

. Be consistent with use of strings and ints.

. Support other databases: 
..  remove all ENUM columns from database
...  nt_zone_record.type should be a numeric code from the resource_record_type table

. Support for NAPTR records: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3403

. SPF records: when creating or editing a SPF record, check for an TXT record. If it doesn't exist, automatically create it. If exists, update it with the SPF record: RFC 4408 ("recommends to always provide a TXT based SPF RR...and duplicate the information from the TXT")

. Limit the num of export logs retained. Perhaps 1 week, or 100 records per NS, or some similar method.

==== COMPLETED =====

. Support for SPF record type

. Collate a useful export report and DROP nictool.nt_nameserver_export_procstatus.

. SQL migration query to populate nt_zone_nameservers from nt_zone.ns0..ns9

. Crypt the user passwords (requires schema changes)

. Make sure password length is not longer than SQL table allows. otherwise, 
   matching password will get truncated in the table and won't match upon 
   auth attempts. DONE - mps 10/13/2007

. Update documentation for API to note limit of 100 record max.
   (https://www.tnpi.net/support/forums/index.php/topic,800.0.html) 
   - DONE - mps 10/13/2007

. Fix Sanity checks which have changed with API/Permissions changes
    group,user,zone,record,nameserver - DONE -gws 3/4/02

. Fix bug: get_group_zones (And other functions which conform to the
search interface) should error if the "x_option" parameter (or others)
have an incorrect value: can be done in Sanity
    DONE - gws 3/4/02

. Matt's bugs: Sanity check on new resource records for conformance to
RFC 1035, as much as possible.  Determine policy re: DNS lookups
...maybe allow it to work, but issue warning about possibility of
non-conformance to RFC.
    DONE - gws 3/1/02

        4a. Modify NicToolClient to deal with Warnings explicitly that are not
failures.

. Upgrade script for v 1.06x to v 2.00
        - add nt_perm tables
        - add entries in nt_perm for all groups
        - prompt install person for permissions for non-root groups?
        
. Complete test scripts to test new features, verify old things work
correctly:
        6a. make sure Client Framework code is good/is working
        6b. write the damn scripts, (should be easier w/ client framework)
        6c. write sample scripts + documentation to make it usable.
        6c. Maybe package Client Framework separately from NicToolServer, like
with NicToolClient or something..

. API DOCUMENTATION NEEDS TO BE UPDATED: gah, lots of changes, fixes to
old bugs need to be done......YOU CAN HELP: maybe...
This item has the highest usefulness vs. enjoyability rating in terms of
finishing NicTool

.undelete for zones/finding deleted zones
    DID  3/4/02 -  changed edit_zone to allow 'deleted' parameter to undelete deleted zones (no way to delete that way) (cannot undelete zone if the same 'zone' is used by a non-deleted zone)
                -   changed delete_zones to not delete records
                -   changed get_group_zones to allow 'search_deleted' parameter to
                        perform search only on deleted zones



----OLD----
- sanity when moving objects
- security when moving objects
- tweaks for gracefully handling reverse DNS
- nt_zone_nameserver_log 
- import tools
	- BINDParse, DJBParse perl modules
	- web interface tools
	- command line tools
- double check that everything from network is dbh->quoted
- transaction queueing layer, examine possible failure points, solutions
- make dist should clean out developer-specific DB usernames/passes, etc (*.sql)
- DES encrypt client-local messages (to thwart cross-site scripting hacks)
- standardization of error/response codes
- multiple xml-rpc/SOAP per-connection -- keep-alive: possible?
- SSL layer testing
- user documentation
- soft errors/warnings
- nameserver permission check (need to define exact policy first)
- client/server versions could differ, but should be displayed by client
