# NOTE: string values do not need to be enclosed in double quotes, but it is
# recommended.  Leading and trailing whitespace is skipped, so if
# a value needs to contain leading or trailing space characters (for
# a password maybe) then enclosing the entire string in quotes is a good idea.
# Similarly, if the value contains leading or trailing double quote characters
# enclose the whole thing in double quotes.
