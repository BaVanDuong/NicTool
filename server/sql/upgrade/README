Upgrading from NicToolServer v2.00-v2.04 to 2.05:

  mysql -u nictool -p nictool < update_v2_05.sql

****WARNING****

Before you run this script you should make a COPY of your old 1.06x database
and then specify this copy when you run the upgrade.

****WARNING****

Upgrading your database to work with NicToolServer 2.00 from 1.06x:

./upgrade.pl -test

This upgrade script will prompt you for the hostname and root password
for your mysql databse.  It will then prompt for a username and password
for the database user that NicToolServer will use to connect to the database.

Before it does anything to your database it will ask you if the information
you supplied is correct.

When you specify "-test" on the commandline it won't actually do anything
to the database.  When you want to actually upgrade your (duplicate) database,
just type:

./upgrade.pl

When it proceeds, it will add the new tables needed to the database and 
modify the ones that need to get modified.  It will also add permissions
(in the NicToolServer sense) for every existing Group object in the database.

The permissions will by default be full access, effectively the same 
functionality as NicToolServer 1.06x.  You will have to go through and change
the permissions by hand for any Groups you don't want to have full permissions.
